Woo! AERO/SIMS rool.

Use this repo for all your aero/sims files, except for openrocket files, which are so special we gave them their own repo.
Ideally, try to put everything in the approriate file. I've done my best to sort the files, although there are still some files stuck in main that I can't move for some reason.
