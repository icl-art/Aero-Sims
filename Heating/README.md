## Tip Heating Calculations

![Calculations](./Calculations.jpg)

Using equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 (which can be found in the ICLR heating calculations wiki page), an iterative equation (5) can be developed to solve for equlibrium wall temperature. Alternatively, equation 6 can be solved using MATLAB, although it is important to initialise properly in order to solve for the correct root. Development is ongoing.

This applies to any flow, although **these calculations are not up to date**
