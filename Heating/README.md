## Tip Heating Calculations

![Calculations](./Calculations.jpg)

Using equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 (which can be found in the ICLR heating calculations wiki page), an iterative equation (5) can be developed to solve for equlibrium wall temperature.
This applies to any flow, although **these calculations have not yet been verified**
